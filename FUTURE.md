# Koda Roadmap

Future features and competitive positioning.

**Koda's core strength:** Single compiled Rust binary, multi-provider LLM
support, zero runtime dependencies. No other agent matches that deployment story.

**What shipped in v0.1.x:** Core file/shell/search tools (15), 6 LLM providers,
5 embedded agents, parallel tool execution, streaming markdown, image analysis,
session management, auto-memory, context compression, headless/CI mode, prompt
caching, `/diff` review, clipboard integration, onboarding wizard.
See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## v0.1.x — Extensibility & Security

### MCP Protocol (Top Priority)

**Priority:** Critical. This is Koda's single largest feature gap.

**What:** Support the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
for extensible tool servers. MCP allows third-party tools to be exposed
to the LLM via a standardized JSON-RPC protocol.

**Why it matters:** Every major competitor supports MCP (Goose has 70+
servers, Claude Code and Code Puppy both support it). Without MCP, Koda
is limited to its 15 built-in tools. With MCP, it becomes infinitely
extensible while keeping the single-binary advantage.

**Scope:**
- MCP client (stdio and SSE transports)
- Auto-discover tools from connected servers
- Merge MCP tools into Koda's existing tool registry
- Configuration via `koda.toml` or project-level config
- `/mcp` slash command to list connected servers and tools
- MCP resources and prompts support

**Non-goals for v0.1.x:** MCP server mode (expose Koda's tools to
other agents), sampling.

### Per-Tool Permission System

**What:** Granular permissions: `always_allow`, `ask_before`, `never_allow`
per tool name. Stored in `~/.config/koda/permissions.toml`.

**Why:** Current binary approve/reject is too coarse. Users should be able
to auto-approve `Read`/`List`/`Grep` while always confirming `Bash`/`Delete`.
Goose and Claude Code both have this.

### Plugin / Hook System

**What:** Allow users to extend Koda without forking. Hooks at key
lifecycle points:
- `pre_tool_call` / `post_tool_call`
- `on_edit_file` / `on_shell_command`
- `on_startup` / `on_shutdown`

**Approach:** Start with JSON/TOML config pointing to shell scripts
(lightweight, no new runtime). Consider WASM plugins later.

## v0.2.0 — TUI & Multi-Model

### Concurrent TUI with Non-Blocking Input

**Vision:** Separate the input loop from the execution loop so the user
can type new prompts while Koda is thinking or executing tools.

**Architecture:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Scrollable output area                              │
│  (streaming LLM response, tool output, agent results) │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ > type your next prompt here...                       │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ /help · claude-sonnet-4 · ctx: 12% · ⚡ 2 tasks running │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Three regions:**
1. **Output area** (scrollable) — streaming responses, tool banners
2. **Input line** (always active) — type while output is streaming
3. **Footer bar** (persistent) — model, context %, active task count

**Implementation:** `ratatui` + `crossterm` (already a dependency).
Two tokio tasks communicating via `mpsc` channels.

**Migration path (incremental):**
1. Persistent footer bar (model, context %, shortcuts)
2. Separate input into its own tokio task
3. Scrollable output area (full ratatui alternate screen)
4. Parallel task queue with collapsible task groups

### Lead-Worker Multi-Model

**What:** Use a powerful model (e.g., Claude Sonnet) for initial planning
turns, then switch to a cheaper model (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) for execution.
Goose has this; it saves significant cost on long sessions.

### More Providers

Priority additions: Ollama, OpenRouter, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock.
These cover most enterprise and local-first use cases.

---

## Future (Unscheduled)

Ideas tracked but not yet prioritized. Will be scheduled based on
real usage patterns and demand.

### IDE Integration (VS Code Extension)
VS Code extension communicating with Koda via IPC/WebSocket.
Goose and Claude Code both have this.

### Agent Teams — Git Worktree Isolation
Parallel WRITE operations via git worktrees. Each agent gets its own
checkout, branches merge after completion. Phase 1 (parallel read-only)
is already shipped. Phase 2 only matters when users need parallel writes.

### Browser Automation
Playwright-based browser control for web testing, scraping, and UI
interaction. Code Puppy and Goose (ComputerController) have this.

### Tree-Sitter Code Analysis
AST-based code analysis with call graphs and symbol extraction.
Goose's Analyze extension supports 11 languages via tree-sitter.
Would replace text-based grep for structural code understanding.

### Document Parsing
PDF, DOCX, XLSX reading. Goose has this via ComputerController.
Low priority — most coding agents don't need office documents.

### Scheduled Tasks
Cron-based agent execution. Goose has `tokio-cron-scheduler`.
Only useful once Koda has a server/daemon mode.

### Skills / Recipe System
Declarative YAML workflows with parameters and sub-tasks.
Goose's recipe system is a differentiator. Worth considering
once MCP and permissions are solid.

## Security Audit Findings — 2025-04-01 ✅

**Status:** Documented.

### RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (Medium severity 5.9)

- **Crate:** `rsa` v0.9.10 (transitive dependency)
- **Issue:** Marvin Attack — potential key recovery through timing sidechannels
- **Affected dependency chain:** sqlx → sqlx-macros → sqlx-macros-core → sqlx-mysql
- **Solution:** No fixed upgrade available yet

**Impact Assessment:**
- Koda primarily uses SQLite (WAL mode) for local storage
- MySQL support is available via `--base-url` but not the primary use case
- The attack requires cryptographic timing sidechannels, which is unlikely in this CLI agent's threat model
- This is a low-priority finding for the current architecture

**Decision:** Monitor for upstream fix. No immediate action required.

### Additional Warnings (Low Priority)

**RUSTSEC-2025-0141: `bincode` is unmaintained**

- **Crate:** bincode v1.3.3
- **Dependency chain:** syntect (markdown highlighting)
- **Assessment:** Stable crate, no security vulnerabilities. Replacement `bincode2` exists but not required.

**RUSTSEC-2025-0119: `number_prefix` is unmaintained**

- **Crate:** number_prefix v0.4.0
- **Dependency chain:** indicatif (progress bars)
- **Assessment:** Stable crate with no known issues. Used for human-readable size formatting.

**Overall Assessment:** All warnings are low-priority. Koda's zero-dependency binary architecture remains intact.
