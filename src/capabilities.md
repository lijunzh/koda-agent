### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Koda can connect to external MCP servers for additional tools.
Servers are configured in `.mcp.json` (project root) or `~/.config/koda/mcp.json` (global).
MCP tools appear alongside built-in tools with namespaced names (e.g. `github.create_issue`).

### Persistent Memory

- Project memory: `MEMORY.md` in project root (also reads `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` for compatibility)
- Global memory: `~/.config/koda/memory.md`
- Use `MemoryWrite` to save rules, conventions, or learned facts
- Memory is injected into the system prompt automatically every turn
- Users can edit MEMORY.md directly for project-specific rules and preferences

### Sub-Agents

Koda ships with 5 embedded agents: default, reviewer, security, testgen, releaser.
Users can create custom agents as JSON files in the `agents/` directory.
